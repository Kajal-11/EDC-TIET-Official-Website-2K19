                            Internet of Things (IoT) is a new revolution of the Internet and a hot technology worldwide. The Government, academia and industry are involved in different aspects of research, implementation and business with IoT. To introduce the students to this revolutionary branch of technology, a 4-day boot camp was organised by EDC in the collaboration with the University of Berkeley in TIET from 19th November. The objectives for the workshop were to bridge industry-academia gap by understanding latest technology trends, developing Jobs 4.0 skills like empathy, co-creation, customer development and business model innovation and Scouting for technologies, innovations, start-ups solving some of the pressing challenges to develop a smart city. It was a total interactive session where participants were given a lot of opportunities for developing their skillset and doubts were taken openly by the mentors.
                            On the Day 1, Students were divided into teams and were assigned specific tasks to improve in the world using IOT and this session was devoted to getting new ideas from them. One of the session was devoted to organizing skills, the teams were asked to use stickers to highlight points and organize them on canvas to see goals clearly.<br>
                            Moving on Day 2, It was totally based on Linux and Python. The Participants were informed about Accessing Linux terminal and Virtual Serial Interface like PUTTY/Tera term was the most important session of the day due to the dependence of IOT on Linux Participants were informed about Shell commands and utilities, shell scripting and Linux related IoT components.
                            Tutorials on python platform application development, Python variables, data types and functions, Strings, tuples, Lists, dictionaries were part of Python session.<br>
                            The Day Three was based on Connectivity and Cloud-based Solutions for Industry 4.0. Building IoT applications for smart cities. One of the most important session was for cloud networking in smart cities. Due to really fast growing world, cloud network has been the most accessed network, so the students were taught about the Thing Speak cloud management framework for data logging and data visualization Coding and data, logging on the cloud. Each session was followed by a Tea Break to provide caffeine for energy. The last and most important day was the day of pitching where the team finally submitted their ideas using the concepts taught in the workshop. Teams pitched their ideas and the best pitch was selected and it was marked as the end of the boot camp.
                            The event was organised well by EDC and the University of Berkeley, the participants were really satisfied with the gain in experience, knowledge and skillset.
